<h1> SOC SIEM Practice - Wazuh </h1>
Hello! This repo contains write ups, files, scripts, or other useful information as I dig into SIEM management for this home-lab.

<h1 align="center"> Goals </h1>

<div align="center">

Wazuh is an open source SIEM and XDR platform with <a href="https://wazuh.com/about-us/#:~:text=A%20world%2Dleading%20cybersecurity%20platform&text=Our%20platform%20has%20more%20than,rely%20on%20our%20solution%20daily.">millions of downloads</a>. Online searching lead me here as a good place
to start learning how to protect endpoints. While my endgoal is to get certified in Splunk, and I have work experience managing end devices in Intune, this will be different as I am setting up the architecture, enrolling devices, and getting into the gnitty gritty of a SIEM.
